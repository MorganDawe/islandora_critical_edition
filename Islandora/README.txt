This folder has all the files necessary to make Islandora work with CWRC .18

Included are custom CSS and JavaScript files required to interact with the 
new CWRC-Writer API. Most top level Islandora functionality is wrapped up 
in the 'islandora_writer_wrapper.js' file. That said, there is a file called
'delegator.js' located in 'CWRC-Writer/src/js/delegator.js' that, in the 
future, should be overridden and placed in this '/js' directory.
